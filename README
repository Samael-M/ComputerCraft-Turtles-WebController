Current idea:

url/controllers/                Base URL, list turtles you can work with, along side a way to register new turtles
            /'register'         Clicking a name of turtle, will open page to interact with that turtle and show its status
            /'turtle name'      From home, clicking register will bring you to page to register turtle


How do we want to do the registration process?
